This is a downloader made by (Rahul Pandey) me as a minor project.
Written in Python 2.7.

 Needs FIREFOX  browser and  the gecko driver for firefox installed to proceed.
I have included it in the library along with other files inside the zip file "Reqs.tar.gz".

Extract the file and paste the folders inside into the same working directory as the script.
Copy/Move the gecodriver to /usr/bin

Other dependencies include :
	1. Selenium module for Python2

This is a command line script for Linux, which does the following:

1) Downloads the Youtube video if its link is copied to the ClipBoard
2) If no link is found then asks if you: 
		
		a) Want to browse FACEBOOK: asks for username and password
		
		b) Want to search for a video on YOUTUBE and then download it
		
		c) Want to download the lastest of an any ANIME.
		

I am planning to make a GUI for this soon as well as port this to Python3 ASAP.

**After the 25th of December the Anime downloader will stop working as the website it refers will shutdown. I will fix this in January 2019.
